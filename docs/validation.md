# Validation report — 2026-11-01

## Environment and upstream

- macOS 15.6 (24G84), Apple Silicon (`arm64`); SIP enabled throughout.
- Xcode Command Line Tools, Apple Clang 17.0.0 (`clang-1700.0.13.5`),
  macOS SDK 15.5. Full Xcode is not installed; LLDB is available.
- Upstream base: `dd845723416f5fe92af49fad5ebab00369e07edd`, yabai 7.1.25.
  Complete history: 1,706 upstream commits; not a shallow clone.
- Fork: `Stevenqx/yabai-v`, created and confirmed by the user.
- Checkout: `/Users/steven/Workspace/Github/yabai-v`, branch `feat/vspace-smoke`.
  `~/Developer/yabai-fork` is outside the session's writable roots; relocation
  instructions are in `development.md`.

| Modified `make -C tests` | Passed, 6/6 |
| `git diff --check`, shell syntax, workflow YAML/matrix | Passed |
| Clang static analyzer, arm64 `src/manifest.m` | No findings |
| Live `USER=yabai-fork-dev ./bin/yabai -m vspace --ping` | Exact JSON: `{"status":"ok","component":"vspace"}` |
| Live missing/unknown vspace command and `--ping extra` | Expected errors and unsuccessful exits |
| Live `query --displays`, `--spaces`, `--windows` | Passed for original and development daemons |
| Window focus and switching existing Spaces | GUI follow-up attempted; both skipped by safe-test conditions |
| GitHub Actions macOS 15/26 | Workflow configured; not published or run |

The query snapshots return arrays with integer IDs, matching field names and
counts: 3 displays, 4 Spaces, and 5 windows. The four new headless tests exercise
the production dispatcher: exact ping JSON, missing/unknown commands, and extra
arguments. The two existing geometry tests still pass. Existing domain handlers
and BSP/stack/float implementations are unchanged.

The GUI follow-up found no suitable pair of visible terminal/project windows on
the focused Space and no second ordinary Space on the focused display. It skipped
those operations instead of creating Spaces or focusing unrelated applications.
Actual focusing and Space switching remain unverified in this report. macOS 26
runtime behavior also requires a separate host/session.

## Signing, failures, and limitations

The user created the persistent `yabai-fork Development` certificate. The binary
has identifier `com.yabai-fork.development` and a certificate-based designated
requirement with leaf SHA-1 `85c2410619477a69b324ed91bb1ff677f4e2e775`.
Retain the certificate and private key across rebuilds. Both the signing log and
live test verify the certificate-signed universal executable outside the sandbox.
Sandboxed verification cannot read the user's trust and reports
`CSSMERR_TP_NOT_TRUSTED`; this does not reproduce in Terminal.

The first daemon startup failed because Accessibility permission was missing.
The user granted permission manually and subsequent smoke tests passed. An initial
manual focus command used an `ID` placeholder, which did not validate focusing;
the follow-up applied the safe-test conditions described above. Baseline and
modified test builds emit the same five upstream CoreVideo deprecation warnings;
production builds emit no warnings. No regression was detected in the tested
paths. GUI skips and unrun macOS 26 checks limit that conclusion.

## Original installation and recovery

With explicit approval, the manual test temporarily paused the original service,
ran the development daemon with dedicated IPC names and an explicit float config,
then stopped it and restored the original service. Restoration succeeded after
each attempt, including the permission failure. The final original LaunchAgent
is running from `/opt/homebrew/bin/yabai` (PID 83673 when checked), and its
`query --displays` succeeds. No competing window-managing daemons were started.

The following SHA-256 values match before and after validation:

| Original file | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/yabai/7.1.25/bin/yabai` | `372ad557a7c54a6199a78dcbcefe5b60fd0224e5c1f5139cfaed00dfdaa44501` |
| `/Users/steven/.dotfile/yabai/yabairc` | `712f2e9cb720bb811aa0a86010d0881d9db018b9876beae8c7a1a86c7125f6fc` |
| `/Users/steven/Library/LaunchAgents/com.asmvik.yabai.plist` | `0a9af809f52d335cda53616a8f6c1d89dd0bc6b8ccf5074a9c7d8f476cf7b1b7` |

No existing configuration or binary was replaced. Accessibility was granted
manually for development; no TCC reset was performed. No scripting addition was
installed or loaded, no sudo was used, and SIP remained fully enabled.

## Workflow and next step

This sandbox cannot access GitHub or write the checkout's `.git`. Four focused
Conventional Commits were prepared in `/private/tmp/yabai-fork-setup.git`, with
the full upstream history. A complete Git bundle and guarded import helper allow
manual import into the checkout without replacing working files. The helper also
sets `origin` to `https://github.com/Stevenqx/yabai-v.git`; `upstream` remains
`https://github.com/asmvik/yabai.git`. Nothing has been pushed.

Logs: `/private/tmp/yabai-fork-signing.log`,
`/private/tmp/yabai-fork-runtime.log`, and
`/private/tmp/yabai-fork-runtime-gui.log`.

Next: review the commits and run the CI matrix after pushing is explicitly
authorized; complete macOS 26 and safe GUI validation. Then design daemon-owned
virtual workspace state and SIP-compatible window visibility/assignment boundaries
before implementing workspace logic. No GUI project or workspace management is
included in this milestone.
